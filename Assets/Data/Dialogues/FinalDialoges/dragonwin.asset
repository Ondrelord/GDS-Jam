  sentences:
  - After you read the book you were almost certain that you don't want to face the
    Dragon in its full power. You came out with a genius plan to kill another animal
    and stuff it with goods.
  - Thanks to some villagers you were able to place the decoy out in the fields and
    wait. After the Dragon ate the bait, you rushed out in the field, equipped and
    encouraged, you managed to slay the beast.
