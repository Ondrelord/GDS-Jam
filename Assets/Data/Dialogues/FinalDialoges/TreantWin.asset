  sentences:
  - After your marvelous research you have found out where the Treant is hiding.
    Obviously in the forest. You come to the darkest place in the forest and begin
    to damage some random trees to provoke the Treant. And it worked.
  - One of the oldest and widest trees suddenly moved your direction. Movement was
    so slow, you would more probably die from old age. So you take matters into your
    own hands and end this masquerade.
